## Overview

DeepEye-SQL treats Text-to-SQL as a software engineering process rather than a single-shot generation task.
It decomposes the problem into grounding, schema linking, implementation, debugging, and final selection, then coordinates those stages with structured snapshots and execution-aware checks.

The repository contains the research pipeline used for our SIGMOD 2026 paper, with support for BIRD, Spider, and Spider2. From-scratch reproduction instructions live in the dataset-specific runbooks under [docs/](docs/README.md).

## Highlights

| Capability | What it provides |
| --- | --- |
| Software-engineering pipeline | A staged workflow for grounding, linking, generation, revision, and selection. |
| Dynamic few-shot retrieval | Automatic training-set indexing with LLM-based question/SQL masking and preliminary-SQL-guided retrieval. |
| Checker-based SQL revision | Syntax, execution, and result-level repair before final selection. |
| Execution-aware selection | Candidate SQLs are compared with database feedback instead of relying only on model preference. |
| Structured snapshots | Long-running experiments are resumable, inspectable, and exportable. |

## News

| Date | Update |
| --- | --- |
| **2026-07-10** | **Qwen3.6-27B achieves 78.4 EX on the BIRD test set.** |
| 2026-07-02 | Added dynamic few-shot retrieval, model-organized config templates, unified dataset wrappers, and public runbooks for BIRD, Spider, and Spider2. |

## Results

| Benchmark | Metric | Score | Model | Public Output |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| BIRD-Dev | EX | **74.5** | Qwen3.6-27B | [prediction JSON](results/bird-dev/qwen3.6-27b.json) |
| BIRD-Test | EX | **78.4** | Qwen3.6-27B | not released |
| Spider2-Lite | official score | **38.2** | DeepSeek-R1 | [outputs](results/spider2-lite/deepseek-r1) |
| Spider2-Snow | official score | **50.5** | DeepSeek-R1 | [outputs](results/spider2-snow/deepseek-r1) |

## Runbooks

The root README is intentionally kept as a project overview. Use the runbooks for setup, config edits, dataset preparation, execution commands, inspection, export, and evaluation.

| Dataset | Runbook | Template families |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BIRD | [docs/bird.md](docs/bird.md) | `config/template/*/config-bird-dev.toml`, `config-bird-test.toml` |
| Spider | [docs/spider.md](docs/spider.md) | `config/template/*/config-spider-test.toml` |
| Spider2 | [docs/spider2.md](docs/spider2.md) | `config/template/*/config-spider2-lite.toml`, `config-spider2-snow.toml` |

Tracked config templates are grouped by model under [config/template](config/template/). Local experiment configs should be copied under `config/local/<model>/`, which is ignored by git.

## Repository Map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [app/](app) | Core config, dataset, database, LLM, prompt, service, vector index, and pipeline code. |
| [app/few_shot/](app/few_shot) | Dynamic few-shot masking, indexing, retrieval, and runtime preparation. |
| [config/template/](config/template) | Public model-organized TOML templates. |
| [docs/](docs) | Dataset-specific runbooks for fresh-checkout reproduction. |
| [runner/](runner) | Python entry points for individual stages, export, inspection, and evaluation. |
| [script/](script) | Shell wrappers for dataset-level runs. |
| [results/](results) | Released predictions and benchmark outputs. |
| `workspace/` | Generated local snapshots and intermediate outputs. Ignored by git. |
